Hey everyone.

This is the very hastily put together, but hopefully successful Portable Capstone script folder. Below are the directions for how to set it up.

1.) Install Python if you do not already have it.
2.) Make sure Maya is already closed.
2.) Put the "capstone_scripts" folder on you Desktop.
    A.) WARNING: DO NOT CHANGE, RENAME, OR MOVE THIS FOLDER FROM YOUR DESKTOP
3.) Double click the file labeled "install_capstone_shelves.py"
4.) Reopen Maya.
5.) If something is not working, please contact me immediately.

Hope this works. Enjoy everyone, and stay safe.
