	<Information text="A series of scripts to help set up the water color pipeline in each shot. It consists of the following buttons:   
*'Create Render Layers': This script takes the current file and creates the 4 needed render layers for the water color look. It also places all meshes in the scene into the layers. NOTE: To use this, you MUST have the masterLayer selected!  'Merge Identical Layers': Mostly to be used in the set files and in the shot files. This script will take everything in the Maya file and re-reference it, making sure that the render layers are shared so that all objects are merged into the layers that already exist in the file. VERY BIG DISCLAIMER: this script re-references everything in the shot that is a reference, including characters. This means that animation WILL NOT be preserved. Make sure that, before running this script, that all animation is saved out so that it can be applied to the rigs again.  'Create Test Renders': Creates one still test render of each layer and places them into a 'test_renders' folder within the shot folder. Will allow lighters to see the current state of their lights.  'Apply lighting_test_mat' Material': Imports the lighting_test_mat material and will apply it to all objects on a layer. NOTE: You MUST have the lighting_test render layer selected in order for this to be applied to that layer. "/>
