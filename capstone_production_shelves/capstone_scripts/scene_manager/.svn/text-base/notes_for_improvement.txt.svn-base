THINGS TO POSSIBLY CHANGE FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT

connectToMeta and connectChainToMeta should look like      MetaObj.connectTo(obj, attrName)
	makes for a more fundamentally object oriented programming
	
	
	
metaNodes can be created by passing in attributes and by existing nodes, by metaNodes have to be passed many attrs to create by node
possible to create by factory,  MetaObj().create(....) and MetaObj().node(...) 
	separates the object to be created by multiple means easier and more efficent
	also allows possible calls like Meta().isMetaNode(obj), for making places for meta outside functions
	

possibly get side and bodypart from joint labels
	pro, less input into creation
	con, component can possible be labels the same if both joints have same label, (if based on start joint l_leg and l_thigh could have same name) 
	
	
possible interface classes for metaIK, metaFK, and MetaDyn for methods to help with .isIK, .getIKAnim and such

make anim a class which adds the node attrs\fbik, creates shapes, swaps shapes, etc.


make CharacterRig a subclass of RigComponent
